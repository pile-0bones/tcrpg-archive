        <p class="character-opening">The sea has taken countless lives since the dawn of life. It is chaos, it is wild, it is untameable. The sea will swallow you if you underestimate it. And yet, the sea is also freedom. It is the path between worlds, the essense of all life. The sea is beautiful and it is mighty. It only makes sense that the Daughter of the Sea would be the same. Captain Cordelia Bay commands the seas atop her ship, the Vapos LaQuiere, sailing across the world in search of the greatest adventures. She is a conduit of the Weave which lies beneath the waves. If you find yourself crossing paths with her crew, you best hope it's as an ally, for the sea listens only to her own whims.</p>
        
        
        <h1>Backstory</h1>
        <p class="character-opening">Cordelia was born in the late spring, early summer of the year 349, to parents Vapos and Valarie Bay. She was born and raised in the city of Ravensborough in the Oshana Isles. She had a very pleasant and lively childhood, especially being partly raised in a tavern full of interesting people. She grew up in a happy and loving household, which provided her many opportunities and experiences.</p>
        <p class="character-opening">Her father Vapos comes from a sailing background. He was born and raised on an island called Tsunaris in the middle of The Cerulean Sea. At the age of 18, he was tasked with becoming a skimmer, a sailor who deals with trade and transportation for the island, because of this he went on a pilgrimage to prove his sailing skills and gained an appreciation for adventure and travel. After returning home with this new found appreciation, he quickly became disappointed with how little he was actually tasked with sailing. In the summer of 340, Vapos was finally tasked with the mission of traveling to both Amberthorn and Ravensborough, and a year later he decided to leave Tsunaris for good and stay in Ravensborough. Tsunaris is a very secluded island and it is very rare for people to leave it, so as far as Cordelia knows, the ties Vapos had to his family and home had been severed with him deciding to leave. Vapos rarely talked about his home but it is obvious that he missed it at times because he named the tavern he and his wife bought, The Tsunaris Tavern.</p>
        <p class="character-opening">Valarie Bay grew up in the city of Wayfield in Ashlark. At the age of 16 she moved to Ravensborough to stay with her uncle. She enjoyed the ocean that she grew up by and wanted more experiences in a port city. Living in Ravensborough conveniently gave her that opportunity. In the winter of the year 340, she met Vapos and they quickly fell in love. Valerie's uncle, unfortunately passed away not long after this time, but feeling at home in Ravensborough she decided to stay. Three years later, her and Vapos got married and only a couple years after they opened the Tsunaris Tavern together.</p>
        <p class="character-opening">Six years after opening the tavern, Vapos and Valarie had Cordelia. In his journal, Vapos states that she was 6 pounds, 5 ounces and 19 inches. She was a stubborn and difficult child at times, but she was also adventurous and bold. She had a very pleasant and easy childhood full of love and laughter. She grew up learning the many tales, songs and stories of sailors throughout Eyzeldon and grew to love the adventure of the sea. When she was 8 years old, she began to learn how to sail and from that point on her path was certain. She felt drawn to the ocean and fell in love with the freedom and adventure of sailing. She had other hobbies as well. She had a passion for music especially because she grew up surrounded by it, so she learned how to play the flute. This she didn’t pick up as easily as sailing, but she’s very proud of the ability she has to play the instrument.</p>
        <p class="character-opening">Some of her favorite memories from her childhood happened during the Ravensborough annual maritime festival. The festival happens every summer and it includes a renowned boat racing championship. The children get to have their own fun, building toy boats and racing them. She was never a master at building boats and she would always lose the race to her rival Aiden Loob (dark elf). The two of them were frenemies and had a love hate relationship. She would always play little practical jokes on him, for example painting over the “L” on the sign to his family's shop with a “B” so the sign would often read “Boobs Bookstore”. That being said, Aiden was also her first kiss. They were friends even though they would argue and mess with each other.</p>
        <p class="character-opening">When Cordelia was 11 years old, Vapos began to take more frequent sailing jobs. She idolized her father and wanted to be just like him but unfortunately he wasn’t around as often anymore. Looking back Cordelia understands that once you start sailing it’s hard to stop, it’s hard to take that freedom away from yourself, but as a child Cordelia would feel like she wasn’t enough to make him stay. She would feel abandoned.</p>
        <p class="character-opening">In the winter of 363, Vapos decided to save up money to buy his own boat. Vapos had a fascination with the legend of a missing floating island called Ommanmai (OH-men-my). He originally learned about it from his friend Terri when he first left Tsunaris. He made it his goal and dream to find this island and to see for certain the treasures and wonder it concealed. He asked his friends Terri, Charles and Winston to join him on his journey and they all agreed. He would tell Cordelia about the amazement of the island and how it was his dream to find it. It quickly became her dream as well. From that moment on Vapos and his friends began saving their money, working towards their goal of finding Ommanmai. Vapos would still take sailing jobs quite often in order to fund this goal.</p>
        <p class="character-opening">Cordelia grew up meeting a number of interesting people and learned very quickly what kind of adventures laid outside of Ravensborough. She knew that her journey would eventually lead her to the sea, she just needed a push to make that happen.</p>

        <p class="character-opening">At the age of 19, Cordelia met a man named Miles Brandy. A human who has long brown hair, a strong build and sharp facial features. They met at the tavern and a romance quickly bloomed. He was also a sailor, and he would take jobs on different ships here and there <img class="supplementimage-left" height="246px" src="/images/miles.jpg"> (at least that's what he told Cordelia). He’s an extremely charismatic person and people are easily drawn to him. He’s strong and intelligent but below the surface he is manipulative and narcissistic. He takes his ambition too far and he doesn’t respect others unless it benefits him. He treated Cordelia wonderfully at first, giving her gifts, making her promises, spending all the time he had with her. One thing in particular that he gave her was a golden locket that had a flower design, a pearl and a sparrow and inside it held a painted portrait of him. Miles would often leave Ravensborough for weeks at a time claiming it was because of his “job”. When he returned, he would stay for a couple of weeks and then would inevitably leave again. Although this lack of commitment slightly bothered Cordelia, she continued to be at his beck and call whenever he was in town. There were red flags that it was a doomed relationship but she would always ignore the signs. Maybe this was because of her own naivety or maybe this was because Miles always promised her that they would sail the seas together. Cordelia always begged him to take her with him and he always said, one day I promise. His empty promises and thoughtless gifts kept their relationship together and blinded Cordelia to the truth of who he really was. This would go on for almost a year and a half.</p>
        <p class="character-opening">n the summer of 369, Vapos was lost at sea. He left to do one final job before buying his own ship and he never came back. This broke Cordelia's heart. She idolized her father and looked up to him more than anyone else. She was lost. Unfortunately, the situation only worsened with Miles returning about a month later. In short, Miles told her that he could no longer be tied down to her and that there was so much more he needed to do on his own. He told Cordelia that she would never amount to anything and that would hold him back. It could also be that he was disgusted by her grief and couldn’t bear the thought of her leaning on him for comfort. Their relationship ended in flames and invoked a new type of rage within Cordelia.</p>
        <p class="character-opening">After their argument, in a fit of fury, Cordelia threw off her locket and accidentally casted a powerful spell through it. Cordelia had always had magic but nothing quite like this. Her pain and frustration made her more powerful. After that night she decided she would not sit idly by. She had to prove that she was enough and that she could be more than what Miles made her. She also decided that she would do everything in her power to honor her fathers legacy. She started going through her fathers old journals in hopes of learning more about Ommanmai. It was now her goal to captain a boat and find the missing island. She began training herself in magic in order to harness her power. And in the Spring of 370 she began to work endlessly to raise enough money for a ship.</p>
        <p class="character-opening">Cordelia used her locket as a source of motivation. It was a reminder that she always had to prove she was enough. Her anger drove her power. This necklace grew to be incredibly valuable to her and she started to believe that she couldn’t cast magic as powerfully without it. She could never see that she was hanging on to a part of her life that held her back.</p>
        <p class="character-opening">By Winter of 371 Cordelia had bought a ship and had gathered a crew. She named the ship after her father. Her crew even included some of his old friends, Winston and Charles. They set sail not long after and proceeded to raise funds for the next step of the process, getting a loft stone for the ship. It is at this time that Cordelia got a tattoo of moonaster, a flower native to Ravensborough.</p>
        <p class="character-opening">In the fall of 372, Cordelia had raised enough funds for a loft stone and made her way to Autumn Cross to finally retrieve the last piece to the puzzle.</p>
