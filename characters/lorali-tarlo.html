        <p class="character-opening">Lorali Tarlo is a human hunter ranger who owns the battlefield using her returning dagger and with the assistance of her pet fox Bip Bip. Lorali’s limited magic focuses on nature and helps her feel connected to the woods she used to call home. Her fighting style focuses on simply hitting hard with either her returning dagger or her crossbow. Lorali hopes to bring smiles to the faces around her and create a world she and everyone around her can be happy and enjoy living in. Lorali helps out in the Syndicate of Beautiful Adventurers by being the sneaky one of the group. She’s able to get places easily with either Bip Bip or her high stealth and pass without trace.</p>
        
        <h1>Backstory</h1>
        <p class="character-opening">Lorali Tarlo was born to the human prince of Nimar, Adrian Tarlo, and a part-Orc woman from the town of Kitra named Lisa. Adrian ran away from the capital of Kavadon to the small, quaint town of Kitra situated in the middle of the woods as an escape from the troubles of being a royal. He soon met Lisa and fell in love with her. Soon, Lisa became pregnant with Lorali which was not taken well by the kingdom of Nimar. Since Lisa was part orc, the kingdom of Nimar would not have a non-pure heir to the throne so they took Adrian back to Kavadon leaving Lisa alone to raise her child not knowing why Adrian left her.</p>
        <p class="character-opening">Lorali grew up in a home of hatred. Being a reminder of the love she lost, Lisa treated Lorali as a slave day in and day out. She dealt with beatings, verbal abuse, and large amounts of labor to do every day. She was told to never smile and not to talk to anyone else in the village. One day however, she met a young boy named Zeke who lived nearby. Never having talked to another kid her age before, it was a nice break from her hard life every time she saw Zeke. They soon began to form feelings for each other allowing Lorali to understand maybe there is a better life somewhere for her.</p>
        <p class="character-opening">With this realization, at the age of 18 Lorali packed whatever belonged to her and set out to find a better life for herself. She settled into the woods outside of Kitra and lived peacefully. After a couple of days in the woods, due to the trauma she went through by her mother Lorali found herself starting to be unable to recall pieces of her past. She knew she had a mother and lived in Kitra but that was all she could manage to remember. With her memories gone, she was able to live a life of smiles and fun, something her mother would have never allowed. After a while of living in the woods, she stumbled upon a fox following her in the woods. She grew fond of him and after asking his name “found out” his name was Bip Bip. Bip Bip (AKA Bartholomew) is the familiar of Adrian, Lorali’s Dad. He was sent out to watch over Lorali and make sure she was safe. Bip Bip and Lorali would go on to live in the woods together for 7 years before meeting the rest of the Syndicate of Beautiful Adventures in the town of Koville.</p>
