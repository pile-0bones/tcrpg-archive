        <p class="character-opening">An angelic sharpshooter stands backed against a wall, surrounded by enemies and out of bullets; and yet, in one swoop, she fires off rounds of glowing bullets. An elven warrior runs toward a falling building, too far to reach the civilians before they will be crushed; and yet his boots carry him on the wind, swooping in just in time. A gnome steps into battle, far outnumbered, countless projectiles soaring towards him; and yet, his armor protects him, and he walks away unscathed. These are just a few of the miracles created by Gidget Godfrey, the boy genius inventor and innocent heart of the Riftwalkers.</p>
        
        
        <h1>Backstory</h1>
          <p class="character-opening">Lazlo Godfrey AKA the Newt was a Duelist most of his life and made his living inspiring smaller folk to pursue their goals no matter how large they may be. Lazlo made a pretty good amount of money as a gnome ring fighter and became quite the attraction. Daisy Cottonwood was a doctor who worked hard to earn her place in the medical field. She was incredibly intelligent and seemed to have a natural gift to heal. One day she was dragged begrudgingly to a Duel match by some friends where she saw Lazlo compete. Lazlo saw her in the audience and immediately fell in love. He pursued her for quite some time and had to put considerable time and effort into getting her to go out with him. Eventually, she agreed and the two developed a great relationship together. When Daisy was working at a hospital, she was stricken with a mysterious disease that required the family to move up to Oaken Island. Lazlo took a job as a tinkerer and taught his son Ezra how to do the same. Ezra seemed naturally gifted in such a practice so his father jokingly took to calling Ezra by the nickname Gidget when the two worked in the shop together. Gidget and his father developed an extremely close relationship over the years. Eventually, Gidget even felt comfortable telling his father that he was gay, and his father was completely open-minded about it. When Gidget’s sister Kori was born and the Tinkering shop wasn’t making enough money Lazlo joined Oaken’s Vengeance and began encouraging better soldier etiquette when engaging with the public. During his time in the group, the citizens had a better relationship with the group and were relatively happy for a little while. That was until one night, the wyvern attack was much worse. Lazlo was picked up by the wyverns and wasn’t seen again. Since then, Gidget struggled to keep his family afloat as the tinkering shop he worked at didn’t make much money. Occasionally he would have to steal small things in order to put food on the table. A childhood friend of Daisy’s, a half-elf named Illiana (who was also a doctor at the hospital where Daisy worked) offered to help the family by being a sort of caretaker to Daisy when Gidget wasn’t around. After a few months, Oaken’s Vengeance approached the Godfrey household. They told them that if the family wasn’t providing a soldier for Oaken’s Vengeance, they wouldn’t be protected in the coming attacks. Daisy refused to let Gidget or Kori go to fight, insisting that Oaken’s Vengeance was bluffing. But Gidget wasn’t so sure. So he went to a friend of his father’s (who over the years had become an extremely close family friend), a dwarf named Gibbon who taught Gidget a lot of what he knew about smithing and tinkering. Together, the two managed to create a suit of armor that would allow Gidget to fight in battles that would be otherwise deadly. The mask protected his face and the weaponry and magic imbued within the armor kept Gidget alive and his identity hidden while he took up the offer to fight for Oaken’s Vengeance. After a while of fighting off attacks and nearly being exposed by Kori after she discovered his secret, Oaken’s Vengeance decided to send him on a mission to find the Wyvern Nest and possibly the identity of the elusive Rider. He said goodbye to Kori and his mother, whom he told that he had to go down and find work as a tinkerer but that he would send money and letters back, if or when he could. From there, he packed up the suit of armor and a small amount of food and money provided by Oaken’s Vengeance. Then, with great trepidation of what was to come, Ezra Godfrey (now Gidget) left the relative safety of home.</p>
