                <p class="indent"><i>A cold wind blows over a sea of tall grass, illuminated by the moonlight. Tucked between the silently looming hills, the mouth of a cave whistles with the gust. Its walls are angular and neat, carved into a tight downwards spiral staircase downwards. Unnatural in form. Crafted meticulously by hand. The darkness of the underground gives way to the dim light of torches, burning endlessly without fuel.</i></p>
                <p class="indent"><i>Click, click, click, click. The sound of boots against stone echoes down the cavern. A tall figure cautiously descends the steps, listening intently for activity below. After weeks of searching, Lacryma is closer than ever--they may have finally found their target.</i></p>
                <p class="indent"><i>As they take the final steps down, the cramped opening gives way to a single circular room. Long stone tables curve along the walls, covered haphazardly in books, beakers, tools, and trinkets. Shattered glass covers every surface, with a swirling concoction of bubbling liquids splattered across the floor. What once could have been an impressive alchemical laboratory is nothing more but ruins. On the far wall, an enormous splatter of blood, only newly dried--but not a body in sight.</i></p>
                <p class="indent"><i>Lacryma investigates the scene, leafing through books and carefully sidestepping the strange mix of fluids. To their right, an explosive silhouette of ash lines a table and chair, lightly glistening with remnants of conjurative magic. And beneath the table, Lacryma notices something they almost missed entirely: an ash-covered coin, and on it a symbol. The symbol of a hand, bleeding from the palm.</i></p>
                <p class="levelup">ꙮꙮꙮ</p>
                <p class="indent">The party wakes from a restless sleep, ready to begin the next steps of their journey. As they prepare to depart, Katar returns to camp with good news! He tells them about the fortune teller’s offer to scry on the crystalline mage Anatheme for a price of 100 gold pieces. Besides Stick, the party is more than happy to pitch in for it. They return to the fortune teller’s tent, Neith taking the lead. She offers the fortune teller the gold and Anatheme’s tome, sitting across from her and her crystal ball. The fortune teller begins a magic ritual, putting her hands out for Neith to hold, and instantly a vision is projected into her mind:</p>
                <p class="indent">Anatheme limps through a dense forest, searching for something desperately. Quickly, exhaustion sets in, and he falls to the ground. Slowly, he takes his bag from his back, pulling out various alchemical supplies. Lacryma, watching the vision through the crystal ball, notices Anatheme’s distinct lack of confidence compared to when he was spellcasting--it’s clear he isn’t experienced in alchemy, and is using a level of guesswork in whatever he is doing. Frantically, he mixes ingredients together, pouring them out onto the dirt before them. He begins to scrawl a message in the dirt in Undercommon. After finishing his message, it dissipates into the dirt, before a new script begins to scrawl itself into the same space. He grunts under his breath, turning back to a nearby tree… And begins to climb. He makes it to the top of the tree, searching for something. The limits of the vision make it impossible for the party to see what it is in the distance. After a few seconds, he notices whatever he is looking for, and slowly crawls back down, beginning to trek in the direction he sought.</p>
                <p class="indent">The vision fades, and the fortune teller returns the tome to Neith. Alexandria is surprised--she knows those woods. Those were the trees of the O’enoa Forest, home to her and Cora’s druidic grove. The party agrees that they’ll follow his trail. Whatever he’s planning, he needs to be stopped. Oats is the only one with reservations, though. As much as they love adventuring with these people, they have a responsibility as the Chosen of Lathander, and need to prioritize that. Their tune changes, however, when Alexandria mentions that the city of Reitelden is on the way to O’enoa: that’s exactly where they were heading!</p>
                <p class="indent">And with that, the plan is set: forest-bound they go. As they prepare for their journey, they see Lane packing up and getting ready to leave as well. He says his sarcastic goodbyes, but before he leaves, Lacryma stops him to thank him for his help. He’s surprised, but does his best to hide it. He takes the opportunity to brag about his abilities, with a distinctly less rude tone towards them. Lacryma teases him for being controlled by the witch, and he… almost apologizes. With that, he’s on the road, and so is the party.</p>
                <p class="indent">The first day of travel is a beautiful, sunny day. They traverse the grassy plains with ease, with Stick occasionally hopping off Andre the horse to find an interesting bug or fungus. About halfway through the day, though, she spots a dwarf hiding within the bushes. Curious, she asks Oats to stop the cart momentarily to investigate. The dwarf suddenly appears behind her, shushing her and beckoning her up a hill. They sneak forward, making it to the peak of the hill, where a small pond rests within a circle of flowers. At the edge of the pond, 4 enormous, red-and-blue feathered creatures dip their terrifyingly sharp beaks down to drink. The dwarf is enamored, telling Stick he’s going to get closer.</p>
                <p class="indent">Oats’ interest is peaked, and they follow Stick up the hill, and not quietly. Stick silences them, hoping not to startle the beasts. As she distracts Oats by telling them to count the spores on a mushroom, the dwarf makes it right up to the birds. With a shout and a pounce, he mounts one of them! Chaos ensues, as each of the axebeaks break into a flurry of wings and talons. They runs straight in the direction of the carriage, and the rest of the party just barely dives out of the way before they trample it. Off into the horizon they go, the dwarf carried into the unknown.</p>
                <p class="indent">After an hour or two of work, Lacryma and Stick are able to mend the carriage to a functional degree (though the canvas is destroyed beyond repair). They continue their journey in stride, electing not to ask too many questions about what just happened.</p>
                <p class="indent">Day two of travel goes by without issue. As they neared sunset, however, a hill in the distance began to shake and move. It wasn’t just a hill: it was an enormous, rocky beast, with 4 columns of boulders functioning as legs. Its huge strides passed right over the carriage, and with only a few close calls Oats was able to direct Andre away from harm. Lacryma notices a column of wooden planks sticking from one of its legs. Perhaps someone had tamed the great beast.</p>
                <p class="indent">Finally, the party makes it to their next location: Reitelden port. A old and shoddy, but lively little port, the bright lights of Reitelden proper could be seen from just across the vast river. They look for a bar to settle down, and perhaps hear something of interest from the locals. They find a weathered white bar called “The Siren’s Call,” populated by grizzled sailors and the lovely sound of a violin.</p>
                <p class="indent">Neith and Stick go to order drinks from the bartender, a charming water genasi fellow who goes by Seamus. He informs them that Reitelden is the most exciting place in the country, where there’s always somewhere to find good drinks, good friends, and good fun. He offers to give the party a tour tomorrow, as he’ll have the day off. They are more than happy to accept his offer. They also pay for a few rooms to stay the night at the Siren’s Call.</p>
                <p class="indent">Meanwhile, Lacryma and Oats go down to the docks to see about securing passage to Reitelden. While Lacryma has their head turned, Oats approaches a red-headed human woman barking orders at a large array of sailors. She seems to be the captain of three enormous cargo ships. Oats asks about getting a cheap ride, and the captain agrees--so long as they’re willing to work through the night. Oats sees no problem with this! They return to the bar, informing the party of the good news. They promptly return to the docks to sort this out, deciding they will find someone else to take them in the morning.</p>
                <p class="indent">They return to the bar, having dinner together and resting up for tomorrow. They aren’t able to rest for long, however, as just outside they hear an explosion. Chaos spreads, and they decide to check out the commotion. Down at the docks, a plume of smoke rises from one of the cargo ships. From a blasted-open hull in the ship’s side, four strange, carcinous creatures with  pink tentacles sprouting from their mouths emerge and begin to wreak havoc. Behind them, an oozing black sludge pours out onto the dock, growing larger and larger by the second. The party hops into action, starting an onslaught against the monsters. Fortunately, they’re not alone: the Mynen military has shown up from one of their nearby naval vessels, and are just as quick to help in the fight. They fight hard and fight fast, trying their best to avoid the sharp claws and paralytic tentacles of the creatures. They soon discover the black pudding’s weakness: fire. Together, the party and the military barrage the dark mass with fire spells and molotov cocktails, reducing it to nothing but a pile of harmless goop.</p>
                <p class="indent">While the fight rages on, Stick notices something: from the ship, a cloaked figure hops onto a nearby roof and begins to run away. She rushes forward, giving chase to the perpetrator of the attack. They hop from roof to roof, with the figure slinging spell after spell towards Stick. She pushes through it, whittling down her opponent’s stamina with a barrage of arrows. She gets closer, closer, ready to finish the wrongdoer off, when suddenly they cry out for her to “WAIT!” They slowly remove their hood, and Stick’s blood runs cold. Staring back at her is Las, her estranged mentor and best friend.

              <header class="session-header-title">The Hand That Bleeds</header>
              <div class="session-body">
                <p class="indent">Our session begins with a bang: with a crystal-infused Shadar Kai mage to the left, a cackling witch to the right, and an enormous boggle behind, it’s time to roll for initiative! Instantly, the battle breaks loose, with Stick and Neith escaping from their cells now that its abjurative crystal has been destroyed. Alexandria isn’t so lucky, however, and still needs to find a way out. With little other options, she picks up a shattered shard of the crystal, and tosses it straight towards the witch’s cauldron at the center of the room. The results are explosive, as a plume of enormous black tentacles sprouts from the pot, grabbing anything it could reach--which, fortunately, happened to be the party’s enemies. Guiding Bolts are thrown, swords are swung, and Hexes are cast. Despite the upper hand, however, the Shadar Kai mage strikes back. Opening one of the cells, he pulls a white haired, half-orc child out from captivity. Raising her above his head, he stabs his crystal claws straight into her stomach. Alexandria shouts in a great rage, “GIVE ME BACK MY SISTER!"  He casts her aside, his arm now aglow with arcane power, which he sends forth in a necrotic blast towards Neith. It’s clear that his arm is the source of his power, and that power needs to be taken down fast.</p>
                <p class="indent">The party puts all their energy into ensuring the mage is taken down. Meanwhile, the witch casts Crown of Madness on Lane, beguiling him as he turns his sword on Lacryma. The fight continues back and forth, with Katar eventually falling to a particularly painful bludgeon from Big Boggle. Fortunately, Neith is nearby to cure his wounds. The mage isn’t so lucky. In a flash, Stick ambushes him, stabbing him in the back and taking him down, making sure not to kill him (they’ll need him for interrogation, after all). From here, things are looking up for our heroes. Alexandria remains trapped in her cage… So why not do what worked before? She throws another crystal shard into the cauldron, this time creating a strange, almost alien creature that follows her command: attack the witch! They lovingly dub this strange creature “Bogos Binted."</p>
                <p class="indent">The party surrounds the witch, attacking from all sides. Oats finishes her off, creating a zigzag of slash marks across her torso. Bogos Binted fades away with the completion of his task, his life short but oh, so valuable. Big Boggle remains the final threat, taking down Stick in his almighty rage. In one final push, the beast is defeated by Lane, now free from the witch’s grasp. A silence fills the dungeon as their foes have been felled. Victory!</p>
                <p class="indent">Wasting no time, the party gets to work on freeing the captured children. Neith rushes towards Alexandria’s sister, stabilizing her wounds. Oats turns toward the children and reassures them that they will be safe. Neith then joins Lacryma in searching the bodies of the witch and the mage, finding a few magic items:</p>
                <p class="indent"><ul>
                  <li>A Cloak of Blasting, imbued with the power to cast Scorching Ray</li>
                  <li>A Medallion of Thoughts, granting the wearer the ability to peer into others’ minds with Detect Thoughts</li>
                  <li>A Staff of the Python, whose abilities haven’t been divined just yet…</li>
                </ul></p>
                <p class="indent">In addition, Neith finds a small metal coin tucked in one of the mage’s pockets. Engraved into it is <u>the symbol of a hand with a wound in its palm, with a single drop of blood falling from it</u>. She attempts unsuccessfully to hide the coin, and Lacryma grills her on why she wants to hide things from them. Their argument is just starting to heat up when Oats intervenes, asking that they focus on getting the children out of there. Alexandria agrees, she wants to get out as fast as she can so she can check up on her sister. They begin searching for a way to break the crystal’s spell on the cell doors. Lacryma has the idea of using the mage’s magic arm to do so. After a little bit of fiddling, they figure out a way to exert minor control over the arm, deactivating the doors--and draining the mage of energy in the process. Making one last sweep of the room, Katar notices something of interest on a desk on the far wall: a black leather notebook, emblazoned with the same symbol of a hand. He takes it, having a feeling that it would be dangerous in the wrong hands. And with that, they gather the children up and exit the cave.</p>
                <p class="indent">The journey back is a welcome change in intensity. Katar and Neith carry the mage’s unconscious body on a makeshift stretcher, while Stick sits inside the cart entertaining the children. They are tired, hungry, and scared, but her storytelling brings a smile to their faces that they hadn’t felt in some time. Alexandria’s little sister, now introduced as Cora, walks to a nearby bush and grows Goodberries for her fellow escapees.</p>
                <p class="indent">Upon their return to Talsden, they head straight to Ophelia’s orphanage. She is elated to see her children all back in one piece, offering a pie as thanks for their heroism. Before they say goodbye, Oats asks if she knows of any goblin encampments nearby. She doesn’t, but suggests that Oats head towards the city of Reiteldenn, as their town guard keeps a running watch for dangerous groups such as those. The evening falls into night, and the party decides to head back to The Outpost to take a rest. They hide the mage within the cart, hoping not to attract any attention.</p>
                <p class="indent">Before heading to bed, Katar decides to look through the black leather notebook. Inside the cover page, he finds the mage’s name: <b><u>Anatheme Zakaz</u></b>. The rest of the book seems to be written in some foreign script, one which Katar doesn’t recognize. A few diagrams are drawn within, which help him make a few observations; notably, that the crystals they have encountered do not grow like regular minerals, but rather seem to be planted and grown, almost as if they were a living thing. The actual process of doing so remains a mystery to him. He puts the book away, deciding to head to bed and get a further look later.</p>
                <p class="indent">On the first watch, Lacryma and Stick discuss what happened. After a while, Stick notices a figure walking (or rather, jogging) towards the campfire. A plucky halfling woman, with an enormous backpack and a fancy blue vest takes a stop right nearby, exhausted from a long journey. She sets up camp and opens a scroll, intently hunched over it. Lacryma takes note of the back of her vest, which has stitched into it the symbol of a sparrow on a branch. They have seen that symbol in previous adventures--usually attached to someone sticking their nose where it doesn’t belong. Whenever an otherworldly creature appears, these people seem to follow.</p>
                <p class="indent">Lacryma and Stick debate what to do about this traveler. Neither of them trust her, worried she may be up to something. Stick decides to get a closer look at what she’s reading, sneaking up behind her. She doesn’t make it very far, though, before the traveler has noticed her. She tries her best to cover up her intentions, but the traveler sees right through it. She introduces herself as Deirdre, a member of “<i>The Willow Wings, protectors of the Material Plane!</i>" She asks Stick about her business, who admits that they were finishing a job posting here in Talsden. “<i>Funny,</i>" Deirdre says, “<i>I’m here for a job posting too.</i>" Stick decides not to push further, heading back to Lacryma. Lacryma decides to see for themself what Deirdre may be here for, heading back to the posting board. Stick tells them to “eat while you’re out." Caught off-guard, Lacryma tries to play dumb. Stick is unconvinced, and admits that she saw them feeding the night before. She knows they’re a vampire, and she isn’t bothered. Surprised, but relieved, Lacryma goes off to feed and investigate.</p>
                <p class="indent">Searching through the other job postings, nothing else seems to be of particular note--certainly not enough to warrant a protector of the Material Plane to arrive. Lacryma is convinced she must be lying, and reports back about it. They keep on their guard for the remainder of their watch, noticing Deirdre exit camp after about an hour.</p>
                <p class="indent">During the second watch, Oats and Neith discuss their relationship with their faith. Neith talks a little bit about her old hometown, a small fishing village of Kyneytyk worshippers. Oats proudly reiterates that they are the chosen of Lathander, and that their relationship with their god is as good as can be. Neith asks about their quest: what are they doing out here? Oats is reluctant, but does decide to tell her a few of the details. Their parents, not long ago, had committed a treacherous act, stealing some sort of magic item from the church of Lathander. They have been locked away for an unknown period of time for their crimes. Now, as the chosen, Oats has the opportunity to restore their honor and free them, so long as they can find a similar magic item (though they choose not to give any more detail on what the item is). Once they do that, they can move on to their secondary goal: opening their own tailors’ shop, just like their father. Neith mentions that she herself was once considered “chosen" too, but neglects to explain further. Oats continues to ramble on about their god and their family.</p>
              <p class="indent">Interrupting their conversation, however, Neith notices movement coming from within the cart. She creeps closer, and panic sets in. Anatheme has broken out of his restraints, and is making a run for it. She runs toward him in an attempt to stop him, but as they make eye contact, they both freeze. He doesn’t just see Neith… He sees something else. Something deeper inside her. With a single pounce, he plunges his hand into her abdomen. His mouth just inches from her ear, he whispers with rage:</p>
              <blockquote>“We will be freed from our prison."</blockquote>
              <p class="indent">And pulls his arm from her, which now glows brighter than they had ever seen before. He tears a hole in the air beside him, creating a portal. And within seconds, he disappears, leaving Neith on her knees in shock. Oats calls for everyone to wake up, but they weren’t fast enough. He was gone.</p>
              <p class="indent">Neith is frozen, shaking as she stares down at her wound. She casts a cantrip in her hands, as if testing the magic she possesses. The rest of the party comes to her aid to ensure she’s alright. They try their best to comfort her, saying that she did what she could and that it isn’t her fault. Oats, too, feels guilt for what happened--if they hadn’t been talking so much, would they have been able to stop him? Alexandria reassures them that they had already finished the important part of the mission. The children were safe and back where they belonged. Everyone recuperates, and considers attempting to chase down Anatheme in the morning. For now, they continue to rest.</p>
              <p class="indent">In the final watch, Katar decides to get up and find more answers about the notebook. He heads towards the fortune teller he had met the day prior. She welcomes him in, saying she was expecting him. While she cannot translate the script for him, she can do something even better: for a price of 100 gold pieces, she could use the notebook to locate Anatheme. He thanks her and returns to camp, planning to propose the idea to his associates in the morning.</p>
              <p class="indent">With their first quest completed, and more questions than answers, the party rests for whatever was next in store for them…</p>
              <p class="levelup">PASH has leveled up to level 4!</p>

              <div class="session-body">
                <p class="indent">After a long journey, the Party arrives at their destination: The mouth of a dark cave overlooking a small clearing in the forest. Three Boggles stand guard at the entrance, bored and ready for some action. Attempting to appear as friendly as possible, Oats, Stick, and Lacryma approach the Boggles, asking what’s inside the cave. Oats is subject to a Boggle biting their hand, but endures the pain in hopes that the creatures will remain unhostile. Oats speaks to them in Sylvan, discovering that while they do not speak the fey language, they understand it. Regardless, the Boggles make it clear that the party is not welcome here, and allow them to leave. </p>
                <p class="indent">The party discusses their next steps: Stick thinks it’s a good idea to try sneaking in, while Lacryma and Oats agree that distracting them is the best option. Oats enthusiastically volunteers to be the distraction, walking right back up to the little guards. They begin singing a traditional tune from their church, “O Holy Lathander" (with a 17 rolled on their Intelligence check, they’re able to faithfully translate it to Sylvan, too!) The Boggles are enamored, electing to sing along in a terrible, but effective, cacophony. Taking advantage of this opportunity, Stick and Lacryma sneak into the cave.</p>
                <p class="indent">Past the cave’s entrance, they find a door. The door holds 5 gemstones on it of different colors, as well as a single button in the shape of a downwards-facing arrow. Next to the door, they see a small hole in the wall, filled completely with black-purple goop: clearly a product of the Boggles. After some investigation, they see 5 engravings of animals on the wall. They figure out quickly that the animals correspond to the colors of the gemstones: red for crab, green for frog, white for polar bear, black for raven, and blue for dolphin. They spend quite a bit of time trying to decipher what order in which to press down the gemstones.</p>
                <p class="indent">Meanwhile, Oats’ song is quickly losing the interest of the Boggles, so they switch tactics: They begin to draw pictures of their god Lathander with their painter’s tools, hoping to teach them about their god. The Boggles could care less about Lathander, but exuberantly ask Oats to draw each of them instead. Thus, the distraction continues.</p>
                <p class="indent">Stick and Lacryma discover an unfortunate punishment for pressing the gemstones in the wrong combination: a spectral animal matching the last gemstone pressed will appear and attack them. They attempt multiple patterns, none of which are successful as their health is whittled down.</p>
                <p class="indent">By the time the drawings are complete, Stick and Lacryma still haven’t figured out the secret to the door. Oats decides now to attempt to play hide-and-seek with the Boggles! Despite Oats’ roll of 7 on a Persuasion check, they are happy to play… but one of them sprints straight into the cave, and another runs straight into Katar, who was keeping watch of the cart. Oats makes a break for the cave, hoping to catch the Boggle before it’s too late. The other three Boggles have all now seen Katar and teleport towards him using their black goop. Katar dodges their attacks and swiftly chases after Oats.</p>
                <p class="indent">Just as Stick and Lacryma feel close to finishing their goal, chaos strikes! Initiative is rolled as the party, now together again, fights off the Boggles. Oats does sick parkour down into the fight, while Katar does an even more sick backflip, slicing a Boggle in midair. One of the Boggles makes a quick break for the goopy hole, disappearing from sight. The remaining creatures are quickly dispatched: Stick rushes forth and bisects an unsuspecting Boggle from behind, while Lacryma Eldritch Blasts the other into dust. The room goes quiet once again.</p>
                <p class="indent">After quite a bit of struggling, the party finally figures out the puzzle: The gemstones must be pressed based on top-to-bottom of where the engravings are on the wall. They press forth into a three-way fork in the cave’s hallway. To their right, they hear the sound of more Boggles babbling; to their left, they hear the sound of arcane humming and crackling; ahead, very faintly, Stick hears the sound of bubbling liquid. Oats suggests that they split up, but the party is quick to shoot down that idea. They move forward, attempting to break open the door. However, before they get the chance, they are all subject to a terrible crunching noise, followed by a deep, striking pain: behind them, a Shadar Kai woman has just cast Shatter on them. She runs back toward the left hallway, the party in close pursuit. As they enter the room, they see a glowing pedestal. Surrounding it are <u>3 glowing crystals, creating a triangular light around another Shadar Kai spellcaster, who is in the middle of some sort of chant.</u> The first Shadar Kai attacks the party, and commands a Boggle to “Go get the others!"</p>
                <img class="right" src="/images/neithportrait.png" id="neithportrait">
                <p class="indent">Just before an inevitable fight breaks out, the Shadar Kai spellcaster stops in the middle of their chant. They wretch in agony, falling over unconscious. The triangular light starts to shift and distort, and upon the pedestal, a portal is ripped through the space. On the other side of the portal stands a tall, regal human woman: <b><u>Neith Ked</u></b> has joined the battle. Immediately, Neith comes to the rescue, casting Aid on the party. With one swift blow (And an impressive critical hit!) Stick almost single handedly kills the Shadar Kai woman. The party has a brief introduction with Neith, before preparing to fight off the Boggles.</p>
                <p class="indent">Their tune changes, however, when they see the sheer number of foes. Thirty, maybe forty boggles tumble over each other, vicious and hungry for blood. Immediately, the party (wisely) runs to the exit, almost successfully getting away, if not for a Boggle grabbing onto Katar. Oats pulls him back up to safety, and they continue upward. The accursed gemstone door begins to open up once again, and behind the door they see familiar faces: Lane, Alexandria, and the dwarven twins have just solved the puzzle. The party wastes no time explaining, and yells for them to run too! Everyone sprints out together, but with a round of poor Acrobatics checks, all but Lacryma are grabbed by the swarm.</p>
                <p class="indent">Oats, Lane, and Katar are able to successfully break free from the grasp of the Boggles. The others, however, are not so lucky. Slowly, spiraling circles of goop appear beneath them, and they disappear out of sight. The four remaining adventurers stand dumbfounded as the swarm of Boggles return to their cave.</p>
                <p class="indent">Neith and Stick awaken to find themselves in a dark prison cell. Above them sits a glowing purple crystal--the same as each of the other cells they can see in the large, cavernous chamber they stand in. <u>In the other cells, the missing children lay</u>, malnourished and covered in splotches of purple skin. In the center of the room, a hunchbacked woman stares into a bubbling cauldron, and a tall Shadar Kai man reads a book on a desk. The two prisoners hear next to them a booming voice: Alexandria is trapped too. They brainstorm, attempting to find a way out of the apparently magically-locked prison doors, when the man approaches their cell. He sighs, stating “Not fresh enough, but they will do." He does not elaborate further, simply telling them to be careful of the cell’s protective magic.</p>
                <p class="indent">Stick and Neith come up with the plan: Neith will throw Stick upwards, and from there Stick will climb the rest of the way to the crystal. With a 17 from Neith and a natural 20 from Stick, they are shockingly successful! Stick just barely makes it to the crystal, hanging upside down from it. She kicks at the ceiling, little by little dislodging the crystal. She notices that the ridges in the ceiling’s surface suggest that the crystal was only recently placed there. Alexandria is able to distract the Shadar Kai until Stick completes this plan, and the crystal shatters into hundreds of pieces. Neith is taken aback by the arcane energy that releases upon the shattering. The Shadar Kai  runs over, immediately telling the hunchbacked woman (who he refers to as “<u>Madame</u>") to bring someone in to clean up the mess, and to make the rest hurry up in their preparation: “We don’t want anyone to interrupt us, after all."</p>
                <p class="indent">Meanwhile, the non-imprisoned adventurers begin to plan. The party tries to convince Lane to help them save the others, but he isn’t listening. He’s here to do the job and get paid, and if he happens to be able to help, he will, but nobody is getting in his way. The rest decide to follow Lane back into the cave, quickly solving the puzzle once again. They make a beeline straight for the middle hall, opening the door to reveal their allies in their cells. And thus, the two perspectives join. The Shadar Kai is shocked to see them make it in so quickly, while Madame simply cackles, reciting a chant. Behind the party, a great rumbling is heard as an enormous Boggle lumbers behind them. Trapped and surrounded, the party prepares for their hardest battle yet…</p>
